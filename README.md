## Description of Project

This project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This project also includes unit tests for each part of the code as testing is key to making code maintainable.

## Project Requirements

- When the user is prompted for their team members and their information then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- When the user clicks on an email address in the HTML then a default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- When I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- When I start the application then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- When I decide to finish building my team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
